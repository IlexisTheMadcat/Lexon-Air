# Installation
For an easy install, start by installing [Modular Avatar](https://modular-avatar.nadena.dev/docs/intro). You can follow the instructions on that page to install Modular Avatar via the VRChat Creator Companion app. \
The setup is simple! There are two easy ways. \
Drag the prefab into your avatar, position the Lexon Air Target object in front of your hand, then:
- add your hand bone as a source to the target's constraint, then press Activate.
- move the Lexon Air Target object into your avatar's armature under the respective hand bone.

Minimum parameter usage: 33 \
Maximum parameter usage: 49 \
Go into the Lexon Air's MA Parameters component to change the behavior of the [Displays](https://github.com/IlexisTheMadcat/Lexon-Air/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#displays) on remote machines. \
This does not affect the functionality of the game unit.
- 33 - Unsync `LA/Points` to unsync the point display across the network.
- 41 - default (points work but not levels)
- 49 - Sync `LA/Levels` to sync the level display across the network.
